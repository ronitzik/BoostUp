# BoostUp Game
BoostUp is a 3D game created using Unity, inspired by the lessons from the Udemy course "Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D".
This project allowed me to practice and enhance my Unity and C# skills through hands-on experience in game development.

## Features

Physics-Based Movement: The game leverages physics calculations to create realistic and smooth movement for game objects.

Collision Handling: The game includes robust collision detection and response, with specific sequences triggered by different types of collisions (e.g., success, crash).

## Learning Outcomes

Advanced C# Programming: This project significantly improved my proficiency in C# for game development, focusing on script-based movement, control, and collision handling.

Unity Skills: Gained practical experience with Unity's physics engine, particle systems, and scene management, contributing to the overall development of a fully functional game.

## Getting Started
### Controls

A : Rotate left

D : Rotate right

C: Disable collison (Used for Debug)

L: Next level

Space: Thrust upwards

## Gameplay
Navigate through challenging levels, avoid obstacles, and manage your thrust to reach the end point without crashing.
